## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With this challenge I have trained and revised the concept of Responsive Web Design. I tried to push the requirements of this challenge a little bir further and build a fully responsive design. In particular: 

- the concept of desktop-first markup, putting content into semantic, logical chunks and laying it out with flexbox, whenever I could (flexbox rules!), e.g.:    

```html
<section class="section section-cta">
      <div class="container d-flex">
        <div class="cta-primary">
          <h1 class="section-title">All your files in one secure location, accessible anywhere.</h1>
          <p>Fylo stores your most important files in one secure location.
            Access them wherever you need, share and collaborate with friends,
            family, and co-workers.</p>
          <form class="cta-form">
            <input class="cta-input" type="email" required placeholder="Enter your email...">
            <input class="cta-btn" type="submit" value="Get Started">
          </form>
        </div>
        <img class="cta-img" src="./images/illustration-1.svg"
          alt="a huge file, a man and a woman inserting documents into it">
      </div>
    </section>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
